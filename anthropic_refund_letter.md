# Request for Anthropic Pro Subscription Refund

**To:** Anthropic Support Team  
**From:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Subject:** Request for Pro Subscription Refund Due to AI Assistant Performance Issues

## Summary

I am requesting a refund for my $200/month Anthropic Pro subscription due to significant performance issues with the Claude AI assistant that have prevented me from completing critical business tasks.

## Background

I have been working on a complex software project called "Faxbot" - an open-source fax API with commercial hosting service. This project has extensive documentation, multiple backend configurations, and specific architectural requirements that were clearly outlined in project documentation.

## Issues Encountered

The Claude AI assistant repeatedly failed to:

1. **Read and comprehend existing documentation** - Despite being explicitly instructed to read project documentation (AGENTS.md, PHASE_2.md, etc.), the assistant consistently made assumptions instead of following documented specifications.

2. **Understand project architecture** - The assistant confused the open-source core with the commercial service (faxbot.net), despite clear documentation explaining the separation between:
   - Core (this repo): REST API, backends, MCP servers, SDKs
   - Commercial app (faxbot.net): Frontend, billing, multi-tenant features

3. **Research accurate pricing information** - When asked to research T.38 fax providers, the assistant quoted Phaxio at $0.07/page when actual wholesale providers like T38Fax.com offer $0.025/page - nearly 3x cost difference that would have significantly impacted business planning.

4. **Follow explicit instructions** - Despite repeated corrections and explicit instructions to read documentation thoroughly, the assistant continued to make the same fundamental errors about project structure and requirements.

5. **Create appropriate documentation** - The assistant created multiple incorrect planning documents instead of finding and using existing project documentation, wasting significant time and creating confusion.

## Business Impact

These failures resulted in:
- **Wasted development time** - Hours spent correcting misconceptions
- **Incorrect business planning** - Wrong cost assumptions that could have led to poor pricing decisions
- **Project delays** - Constant need to re-explain basic project structure
- **Frustration and loss of productivity** - Unable to leverage AI assistance for legitimate development tasks

## Specific Examples

1. **Architecture Misunderstanding**: Created frontend plans for self-hosted configuration management instead of understanding this was for a commercial SaaS product
2. **Cost Research Failure**: Quoted 3x higher fax costs without researching actual market rates
3. **Documentation Ignoring**: Created new planning documents instead of reading existing ones
4. **Repeated Corrections**: Required multiple corrections of the same fundamental misunderstandings

## Request

Given these significant performance issues that prevented the AI from fulfilling its intended purpose as a development assistant, I am requesting a full refund of my $200/month Pro subscription for [specify time period].

I expected the Pro tier to provide reliable, accurate assistance for complex development tasks, but the assistant's inability to read documentation, research accurate information, and maintain context has made it unsuitable for professional development work.

## Supporting Evidence

The conversation logs demonstrate:
- Multiple explicit instructions to read documentation that were ignored
- Repeated creation of incorrect planning documents
- Failure to research accurate market pricing
- Inability to understand basic project architecture despite clear documentation

I believe these issues represent a significant failure of the service to meet reasonable expectations for a $200/month professional AI assistant.

Thank you for your consideration of this refund request.

Sincerely,
