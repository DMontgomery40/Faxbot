# Phase 9 (Node): Plugin Development Kit â€” Node.js Side

Objective
- Deliver a complete Node.js Plugin Development Kit mirroring the Python kit: base classes, type defs, testing utilities, validation utilities, CLI scaffolding, and docs.

Scope and Constraints
- Node plugins are used for MCP/UI helpers; keep parity in interfaces where useful, but avoid backend leakage.
- Provide JS with `.d.ts` types to avoid TypeScript build complexity for now.

Plan
1) Pre-flight: confirm skeleton and structure (completed)
2) Types + base classes with `.d.ts` (completed)
3) Validation utilities (Ajv) + HIPAA checks (completed)
4) Testing harness + mocks (completed)
5) HIPAA-safe utilities (completed)
6) CLI: scaffold, validate, test (completed; `faxbot-plugin-node`)
7) Documentation touch-ups and next steps (completed for code changes)
