Create Faxbot Plugin System and Home Assistant Plugin Template

Designing a Faxbot Plugin System and Home Assistant Plugin
Designing a Plugin System for Faxbot (Inspired by Scrypted)

To extend Faxbot with a plugin architecture similar to Scrypted’s, we need to enable dynamic discovery, installation, and loading of plugins. Below we break down the required features and how to implement them step-by-step, with guidance and examples for a junior developer.

1. Dynamic NPM Plugin Discovery via Keywords

First, we'll leverage NPM’s registry to discover available Faxbot plugins by using unique keywords in the packages' metadata. By convention, plugin packages will include keywords like faxbot and faxbot-plugin in their package.json. This way, anyone publishing a Faxbot plugin can tag it for easy search. (Including specific keywords in package.json helps others discover the package via npm search
stackoverflow.com
.)

Choose Keywords: We will use 'faxbot' and 'faxbot-plugin' as the standard keywords. Authors of plugins (including internal or third-party) should list these in the "keywords" field of their package.json. For example:

{
  "keywords": ["faxbot", "faxbot-plugin", "homeassistant"]
}


This ensures the plugin will appear in search results for those terms
stackoverflow.com
.

Search NPM Registry: Within Faxbot’s server code, implement a function to query the NPM registry for packages matching these keywords. We can use NPM’s search API or the CLI:

Using NPM Search API: For example, perform a GET request to the endpoint:
https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=keywords:faxbot-plugin
(We could also include faxbot as a term to catch any plugin that might use one keyword or the other.) This returns a JSON listing of packages whose metadata matches the query.

Using npm CLI (for testing): You can try this on the command line with the npm search command:

# Example: search for Faxbot plugins on NPM
npm search faxbot-plugin --json


This will output a JSON array of matching packages. For example, after we publish our Home Assistant plugin, the search result might include an entry like:

[
  {
    "name": "faxbot-plugin-homeassistant",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Faxbot plugin for integrating Home Assistant health data",
    "keywords": ["faxbot", "faxbot-plugin", "homeassistant"],
    ... 
  },
  { "name": "faxbot-plugin-xyz", ... },
  { "name": "@faxbot/core", ... },
  ...
]


Both unscoped (faxbot-plugin-xyz) and scoped packages (e.g. @faxbot/core) will appear as long as they have the proper keywords. Note: NPM search matches keywords and package title/description, so including "faxbot" in the name or description can also help, but using the keywords is the recommended approach.

Implementing the Search in Code: In the Faxbot server (likely an Express API server), you can use a library like axios (already used in Faxbot) to call the registry API. For example:

const axios = require('axios');
async function searchForFaxbotPlugins() {
  const query = 'keywords:faxbot-plugin faxbot';
  const url = `https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;
  const res = await axios.get(url);
  return res.data.objects.map(obj => ({
    name: obj.package.name,
    version: obj.package.version,
    description: obj.package.description
  }));
}


This function returns a list of plugin info objects (name, version, description, etc.). We can call this whenever we need to update the plugin list (for example, when the user opens the Plugins page in the UI).

2. Listing Available Plugins in the Faxbot UI

Next, we will present the discovered plugins in Faxbot’s management UI so the user can easily browse and install them (similar to how Scrypted’s UI allows searching/installing plugins from within the app
docs.scrypted.app
).

Add a "Plugins" Section: In the Faxbot admin interface, create a new section or page (e.g. a "Plugins" menu item). When this page loads, the front-end should request the server for the list of available plugins (calling an endpoint that uses the search function above).

Display Plugin Info: For each plugin returned (name, description, maybe latest version), display an entry in a list or grid. For example, each entry can show:

Name – e.g. "faxbot-plugin-homeassistant" (or the human-friendly name if available).

Description – short description from package.json (e.g. "Integrates Home Assistant health data into Faxbot").

Version – latest version number.

Source/Scope – if you want, you could distinguish official plugins (perhaps ones under the @faxbot scope) with a label, though this is optional.

Install Button – a button to install that plugin.

The UI might look like a list of cards or rows, each with plugin info and an “Install” button.

Example UI Flow: In practice, a user would open the Plugins page, and Faxbot would automatically display all NPM packages tagged for Faxbot. For instance, “faxbot-plugin-homeassistant” would show up in the list (once published), along with any other community or official plugins. The user can then click Install next to the desired plugin.

3. Installing Plugins via NPM

When the user chooses to install a plugin from the list, Faxbot will perform an NPM installation under the hood. This step downloads the plugin package and makes it available to the Faxbot runtime.

Installation Directory: It's good practice to keep plugins isolated from the core application’s dependencies. We can create a dedicated directory in the Faxbot server, e.g. plugins/, to hold installed plugins. This avoids version conflicts between plugins and the core app.

Running npm Install: Upon an install request, the server can spawn an npm process or use a library to install the package. The simplest approach is to use Node’s child_process to call the npm CLI:

const { exec } = require('child_process');
function installPlugin(packageName) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // e.g. install to plugins/<packageName> directory for isolation
    const installDir = `plugins/${packageName}`;
    // Ensure the directory exists
    fs.mkdirSync(installDir, { recursive: true });
    // Run npm install in that directory
    exec(`npm install --prefix ${installDir} ${packageName}`, (err, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(`Error installing ${packageName}:`, stderr);
        return reject(err);
      }
      console.log(`Installed ${packageName}:`, stdout);
      resolve();
    });
  });
}


In this code, npm install --prefix plugins/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant faxbot-plugin-homeassistant will create a plugins/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant folder and install the module into it. Using --prefix ensures the plugin and its dependencies go into that subfolder instead of mixing into the main node_modules.

 

Command-line example: You could achieve a similar result manually with:

mkdir -p plugins/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant
npm install --prefix plugins/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant faxbot-plugin-homeassistant


This downloads the plugin from NPM and places it under plugins/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant/node_modules/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant.

Permission and Security: Make sure the process running Faxbot has permission to write to the plugins/ directory. Also, consider that installing arbitrary NPM packages can be a security risk – you might later implement a verification or allow only trusted plugins. For now, as a basic system, we assume plugins are trusted or the admin knows what they are installing.

Post-Install Feedback: Once the installation is complete, update the UI. For example, the UI can show the plugin as installed (you might list installed plugins separately with an option to remove or update). If the install fails (e.g., package not found or network error), surface that error to the user.

4. Loading Plugins with Basic Isolation

After installing a plugin, Faxbot needs to load and run it. Automatic loading means the plugin becomes active without requiring a server restart. Basic isolation means the plugin runs in a way that is at least somewhat separated from the core app, to prevent crashes or conflicts.

 

There are two main strategies to load and run the plugin code:

(a) In-Process Loading: The simplest way is to require() the plugin’s entry point in the main Faxbot server process. For example:

const pluginPath = require('path').join(__dirname, 
    'plugins/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant/node_modules/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant');
const pluginModule = require(pluginPath);
if (typeof pluginModule.initPlugin === 'function') {
  pluginModule.initPlugin(faxbotAPI);
}


Here, we build the path to the installed plugin module and require it. We then call an initPlugin function (we’ll define this convention shortly) to initialize the plugin. In-process loading is straightforward, but not isolated – the plugin code runs in the same Node.js process as Faxbot, so a bug or infinite loop in a plugin could affect the whole server. This also means the plugin has access to everything in memory. For a quick start and easier debugging, you might begin with in-process loading, but the goal is to improve isolation.

(b) Separate Process (Recommended): Scrypted’s plugin system, for example, runs each plugin in a separate process for stability and security. We can do the same for Faxbot: spawn a new Node.js process for each plugin. This provides isolation (a crash in a plugin won’t crash Faxbot, and memory is not shared).

 

Using Node’s child_process.fork is a convenient way to spawn a new Node process and set up IPC (inter-process communication) with it. For example:

const cp = require('child_process');
const child = cp.fork(
  require('path').join(__dirname, 'plugins/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant/node_modules/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant/index.js'),
  [],  // no extra arguments
  { env: { ...process.env } } // pass environment, including any needed config
);
child.on('message', (msg) => {
  // handle messages from plugin if needed
  if (msg.type === 'log') console.log(`[Plugin log] ${msg.data}`);
  if (msg.type === 'report') {
    // e.g., plugin sent a health report
    handleHealthReport(msg.data);
  }
});


In this model, the plugin code (in its own file) can use process.send() to communicate with the Faxbot parent process. For instance, it might send a message containing the data it collected, which Faxbot then processes or forwards via its API. This design is more complex than in-process, but yields a robust system:

Each plugin runs independently. Faxbot can monitor the plugin process (restart it if it crashes, etc.).

If needed, you can even run plugins with a restricted environment (for example, no access to certain globals or with limited memory) – though implementing a full sandbox is advanced.

Tip: You can start with in-process loading, then upgrade to separate processes when the basics work. The plugin interface (discussed next) can be designed to accommodate both (e.g., the plugin might either export an initializer or, if run as a forked process, simply execute its logic and communicate via IPC).

Auto-Loading on Start: Once the system is in place, consider having Faxbot load any previously installed plugins on startup. For example, keep a list (or simply scan the plugins/ directory) to find installed plugins and load them automatically when Faxbot boots. This way, the plugins remain active after a restart without manual intervention.

5. Plugin Interface and Registration Convention

To integrate seamlessly, Faxbot and each plugin need a common interface or convention. This defines how a plugin should present itself and hook into Faxbot. We’ll design a simple convention:

Exported Initialization Function: Each plugin will export a known function (e.g., initPlugin) that Faxbot calls when loading the plugin in-process. Faxbot will pass a Plugin API object or context to this function. This API allows the plugin to interact with Faxbot’s core features (for example, to register tasks, send data through Faxbot, log messages, etc.).

 

For instance, Faxbot might prepare an object with methods and info like:

const faxbotAPI = {
  sendFax: (toNumber, content) => { /* ... use core Faxbot to send fax ... */ },
  sendHealthReport: (data) => { /* custom helper, or reuse sendFax */ },
  scheduleDaily: (fn) => { /* schedule a daily execution of fn */ },
  log: (msg) => { console.log(`[Plugin] ${msg}`); }
  // ... other helpers as needed
};


Then pass this into the plugin's initializer.

Example Faxbot Side (in-process):

// Pseudo-code for loading an installed plugin in-process
const pluginModule = require(pluginPath);
if (pluginModule && typeof pluginModule.initPlugin === 'function') {
  pluginModule.initPlugin(faxbotAPI);
}


If using separate processes, the “plugin API” might be provided via IPC messages or environment variables. For example, you could pass the base URL of Faxbot’s HTTP API and an auth token via env to the child process, so the plugin can call back to Faxbot's REST endpoints. Alternatively, implement a minimal RPC over the message channel (e.g., the parent sends a message {type: 'init', ...} and the plugin responds when ready).

Plugin Responsibilities: When initPlugin(faxbotAPI) is called, the plugin can:

Register any scheduled jobs or event listeners (e.g. set up a daily task, or subscribe to Faxbot events if such a system exists).

Initialize connections or perform handshake (for example, connect to an external service, or verify configuration).

Use faxbotAPI to send any immediate startup messages or to store its state if needed.

Convention over Configuration: By agreeing on this initPlugin convention, adding new plugins is straightforward. As long as a plugin follows the template (exports the function), Faxbot can load it. This avoids needing complex reflection or configuration files. It’s similar to how other systems operate (for example, Scrypted expects plugins to conform to its SDK interfaces, Homebridge expects a certain export in plugins, etc.).

With the plugin system in place, we can now create a concrete example plugin to test and demonstrate the system.

Creating the faxbot-plugin-homeassistant Plugin

As our first plugin, we will build faxbot-plugin-homeassistant. This plugin will connect to a Home Assistant instance, retrieve health-related sensor data, and send that data via Faxbot’s existing capabilities. Below, we outline how to design and scaffold this plugin, including project structure, authentication, data retrieval, and integration with Faxbot.

1. Project Structure and Metadata

We'll create the plugin as a standalone NPM package. You can develop it in its own folder and even publish it to NPM so others (and Faxbot itself) can find it by the keywords.

Scaffold the Project: Create a new folder for the plugin and run npm init:

mkdir faxbot-plugin-homeassistant
cd faxbot-plugin-homeassistant
npm init -y
npm install axios    # we'll use axios for HTTP calls to Home Assistant


This will generate a basic package.json (you can also add a README.md describing the plugin’s purpose and usage).

package.json Setup: Open the package.json and fill in important fields:

name: Use the naming convention for Faxbot plugins. Here we use "faxbot-plugin-homeassistant". (Alternatively, you could use a scoped name like "@faxbot/homeassistant" if this were an official plugin, but unscoped with a clear prefix works equally well.)

version: Start with "1.0.0" (or 0.1.0 if it's an initial dev version).

description: e.g. "A Faxbot plugin to send Home Assistant health data via fax".

main: The entry point file, e.g. "index.js".

keywords: Include "faxbot" and "faxbot-plugin" here (plus any others relevant, like "homeassistant" for clarity). This is critical so that Faxbot can discover this plugin by search
stackoverflow.com
.

author and license: your info and a license (MIT, etc.).

dependencies: It should list "axios" (and any other libraries you use). Since we installed axios above, it should already be in dependencies.

For example, your package.json might look like this (excerpt):

{
  "name": "faxbot-plugin-homeassistant",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Faxbot plugin to integrate Home Assistant health sensor data",
  "main": "index.js",
  "keywords": [
    "faxbot",
    "faxbot-plugin",
    "homeassistant",
    "health"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name <youremail@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.7.0"
  }
}


Ensure that this file is saved and the keywords are in place. Now our plugin will be discoverable by Faxbot’s plugin search.

File Structure: In the plugin folder, create the main file index.js. For clarity, our plugin directory might contain:

faxbot-plugin-homeassistant/
├── package.json
├── index.js
└── README.md   (optional, to document usage and any config)


You can add other files if needed (for example, if the plugin gets complex, you might split code into multiple modules), but for a simple example one file is fine.

2. Home Assistant Authentication Setup

The plugin needs to authenticate with Home Assistant’s API to read sensor data. Home Assistant typically uses a long-lived access token for API access, and it exposes a REST API at its base URL. We will design the plugin to take in the Home Assistant connection details via configuration. For simplicity, we can use environment variables or a small config file.

Configuration Variables: We will use:

HOME_ASSISTANT_URL – the base URL of the Home Assistant instance (for example: http://homeassistant.local:8123 or http://192.168.1.100:8123).

HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN – a long-lived access token generated in Home Assistant user profile (this is a sensitive string used for API auth).

In a real setup, you might allow the user to input these through Faxbot’s UI and then pass them to the plugin (perhaps via the plugin API or environment). For our scaffold, we will assume they are available as environment variables. During development, you can place them in a .env file and use the dotenv package to load them, or just export them in your shell before running Faxbot.

Accessing Config in Plugin: In index.js, we will read these values. For example:

const HA_URL = process.env.HOME_ASSISTANT_URL;
const HA_TOKEN = process.env.HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN;
if (!HA_URL || !HA_TOKEN) {
  console.error("Home Assistant URL/token not configured. Please set HOME_ASSISTANT_URL and HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN.");
  return;
}


This ensures the plugin knows where to connect and has credentials. The plugin will use HA_TOKEN by sending it in an HTTP header for authentication (Home Assistant expects an Authorization header with a Bearer token).

3. Querying Health Data from Home Assistant

Now comes the core logic: fetching health-related data from Home Assistant. We want metrics like weight, heart rate, blood pressure – presumably these are exposed as sensor entities in Home Assistant. For example, you might have sensors named sensor.weight, sensor.heart_rate, sensor.blood_pressure (the exact entity IDs depend on how the devices are set up in HA, but we'll go with these generic names for now).

 

Home Assistant’s REST API allows GET requests to an endpoint /api/states/<entity_id> to retrieve the current state of an entity. We will call these endpoints for each relevant sensor. We’ll use Axios for HTTP requests.

API Endpoints: Construct URLs like:

${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.weight

${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.heart_rate

${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.blood_pressure

Each returns a JSON object representing the state of that entity, including a state field (the value) and possibly attributes (units, etc).

HTTP Request with Token: We must include the token in the header:

const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${HA_TOKEN}` };
const weightRes = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.weight`, { headers });
const weight = weightRes.data.state;


We do similar for heart rate and blood pressure. (We should also catch errors in case the entity doesn't exist or the request fails, but for brevity, we'll assume they exist.)

Data Handling: The values come as strings (since HA state is often a string). You might convert them to numbers if needed. Also, gather them into a single report. For example:

const heartRes = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.heart_rate`, { headers });
const bpRes = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.blood_pressure`, { headers });

const heartRate = heartRes.data.state;
const bloodPressure = bpRes.data.state;

const reportText = `Weight: ${weight} | Heart Rate: ${heartRate} | Blood Pressure: ${bloodPressure}`;


Now reportText is a summary string of the health data. We could also structure it as an object, but a simple string is fine if we intend to send it as a message or fax body.

Putting it together: Let's write a function inside index.js to fetch all needed data:

async function fetchHealthData() {
  const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${HA_TOKEN}` };
  const weightRes = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.weight`, { headers });
  const heartRes  = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.heart_rate`, { headers });
  const bpRes     = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.blood_pressure`, { headers });
  return {
    weight: weightRes.data.state,
    heartRate: heartRes.data.state,
    bloodPressure: bpRes.data.state
  };
}


This function returns an object with the three values. (In a real scenario, you might need to adjust entity IDs or handle unit conversion, but we'll keep it simple.)

4. Sending the Data via Faxbot

The final step is to take the fetched health data and send it out through Faxbot. Faxbot’s existing APIs presumably include a way to send a fax or message. For example, Faxbot likely has an API or function sendFax() (as hinted in its docs, there is an endpoint POST /v1/fax/send for sending a fax). We will utilize whatever interface Faxbot provides.

 

Since we are writing a plugin that integrates with Faxbot, we have two possible ways to send the data:

Using the Faxbot API object (in-process scenario): If Faxbot passed a faxbotAPI to our plugin’s init function, we can call a method on it. For instance, if there's a helper like faxbotAPI.sendHealthReport(data), or a more generic faxbotAPI.sendFax(number, content). For this example, let's assume Faxbot can send a fax given a destination number and content. Perhaps the Faxbot admin has configured a fax number to send health reports to (say their doctor or themselves). We could store that number in an env var or config as well (e.g., FAX_TARGET_NUMBER). For now, we will simplify by logging or using a stub, because actual fax sending would require knowing the number and maybe formatting content as a PDF or text.

Direct API call (separate-process scenario): If our plugin is running in a separate process without direct function access, it could make an HTTP request to Faxbot’s REST API. For example, use Axios to POST to Faxbot’s /v1/fax/send endpoint with the necessary data (including auth if required). This would send a fax via Faxbot as if an external client did so. This requires that we know the Faxbot base URL and an API key or token. It might be overkill for our demo, so we’ll illustrate the simpler approach.

For clarity, we will assume an in-process call using a provided API. We’ll implement our plugin to use a function faxbotAPI.sendHealthReport. In Faxbot’s core, we can implement sendHealthReport to format the data and call the fax sending service (or even just log it).

Example integration in plugin code:

async function sendHealthData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchHealthData();
    const summary = `Weight: ${data.weight}, Heart Rate: ${data.heartRate}, Blood Pressure: ${data.bloodPressure}`;
    // Use Faxbot API to send this summary.
    // For example, send as a fax or store it.
    if (faxbotAPI.sendHealthReport) {
      faxbotAPI.sendHealthReport(data);
    } else if (faxbotAPI.sendFax) {
      // If there's a generic sendFax, we might use a pre-set number
      faxbotAPI.sendFax(faxbotAPI.config.defaultFaxNumber, summary);
    } else {
      // Fallback: log it
      faxbotAPI.log && faxbotAPI.log(summary);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    faxbotAPI.log && faxbotAPI.log("Failed to fetch health data: " + err.message);
  }
}


This function fetches the data and then sends it. We try to use faxbotAPI.sendHealthReport if available (implying Faxbot could define a custom handler for health reports), otherwise default to sending a fax (if a number is configured), or simply logging. The idea is that the plugin hands off the data to Faxbot to deliver via the appropriate channel.

Scheduling the send: We want this to happen once a day (or on demand). For a daily schedule, the plugin can set up a timer. Since our plugin is likely long-running (Faxbot will keep it loaded), we can use setInterval:

// Schedule the health report to run every 24 hours (86400000 ms)
setInterval(sendHealthData, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);


This will call our sendHealthData function once every day. In a real plugin, you might want to schedule at a specific time of day (e.g., every day at 8am). For that, you'd use a more sophisticated scheduling (maybe node-cron or similar) or have Faxbot trigger it. But to keep it simple, a fixed interval from the time of starting is acceptable.

On-Demand Trigger: Optionally, we could allow the Faxbot user to trigger an immediate health data send (for example, a button in the UI that calls a plugin method). If we had Faxbot API support, Faxbot could invoke our sendHealthData() directly (since we passed it into initPlugin). Or if separate, we could listen for a specific IPC message. Implementing this fully might be beyond initial scope, but it's good to note: our plugin could expose a method to Faxbot (via the API object or by listening to a command) to perform the action on demand.

5. Plugin Registration with Faxbot

Finally, we need to tie everything together by making sure the plugin properly registers itself when loaded. This is where the initPlugin convention comes in (for the in-process model). We will write our index.js such that it exports the initialization function expected by Faxbot.

 

For the separate process scenario, instead of exporting a function, the plugin could just execute the logic on start (since it’s launched by fork directly). But even then, having a structured way to initialize is useful. We will demonstrate the in-process style here, which is also easy to adapt.

Writing index.js: Below is a simplified example of what faxbot-plugin-homeassistant/index.js might contain:

const axios = require('axios');

module.exports.initPlugin = function(faxbotAPI) {
  // 1. Configuration
  const HA_URL = process.env.HOME_ASSISTANT_URL;
  const HA_TOKEN = process.env.HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN;
  if (!HA_URL || !HA_TOKEN) {
    faxbotAPI.log && faxbotAPI.log("Home Assistant credentials not set. Plugin will not run.");
    return;
  }

  // 2. Define helper to fetch data from Home Assistant
  async function fetchHealthData() {
    const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${HA_TOKEN}` };
    const weightRes = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.weight`, { headers });
    const heartRes  = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.heart_rate`, { headers });
    const bpRes     = await axios.get(`${HA_URL}/api/states/sensor.blood_pressure`, { headers });
    return {
      weight: weightRes.data.state,
      heartRate: heartRes.data.state,
      bloodPressure: bpRes.data.state
    };
  }

  // 3. Define the function to send the fetched data via Faxbot
  async function sendHealthData() {
    try {
      const data = await fetchHealthData();
      const summaryText = `Weight: ${data.weight}, Heart Rate: ${data.heartRate}, BP: ${data.bloodPressure}`;
      // Use Faxbot's API to send or log the data
      if (faxbotAPI.sendFax) {
        // Example: send as fax (assuming a default recipient is configured in Faxbot)
        faxbotAPI.sendFax(faxbotAPI.config.defaultFaxNumber, summaryText);
      } else {
        // Fallback: just log the report
        faxbotAPI.log && faxbotAPI.log("Health report: " + summaryText);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      faxbotAPI.log && faxbotAPI.log("Error fetching health data: " + error.message);
    }
  }

  // 4. Schedule the report to run once a day
  setInterval(sendHealthData, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  faxbotAPI.log && faxbotAPI.log("Home Assistant health plugin initialized. Scheduled daily reports.");
};


Let’s break down what happens when Faxbot loads this plugin and calls initPlugin(faxbotAPI):

We check for the required config (Home Assistant URL and token). If missing, we log an error and return early (disabling the plugin).

We define fetchHealthData() to call Home Assistant’s API for each sensor and return the values.

We define sendHealthData() which uses fetchHealthData() and then uses faxbotAPI to do something with the results. In this example, we attempt to send a fax (you would replace faxbotAPI.sendFax with the real method Faxbot provides to send a fax or message). If no such function is available, we default to logging the summary.

We schedule sendHealthData() to run every 24 hours using setInterval. This means once the plugin is initialized, it will automatically perform its task daily. We also log that the plugin initialized successfully.

Testing the plugin (locally): You can test this plugin code independently by temporarily adding a stub faxbotAPI and running node index.js. For example:

// test.js (to test plugin independently)
const plugin = require('./index.js');
const fakeAPI = {
  sendFax: (num, content) => console.log(`[Fax to ${num}] ${content}`),
  log: console.log,
  config: { defaultFaxNumber: "1234567890" }
};
process.env.HOME_ASSISTANT_URL = "http://localhost:8123";
process.env.HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN = "ABCDEFGH1234567";  // (fake token)
plugin.initPlugin(fakeAPI);


Running node test.js would simulate Faxbot loading the plugin. It should immediately log initialization and then, after 24 hours (we’re not waiting that long, but you could reduce the interval for testing), it would attempt to send data. You could modify sendHealthData to call it immediately for a quick test.

Integration with Faxbot: Once this plugin is published to NPM (or at least placed in Faxbot’s plugins/ directory and installed), the user can go to Faxbot’s UI, find Home Assistant Plugin in the list, click Install, and the Faxbot backend will:

Download and install faxbot-plugin-homeassistant.

Immediately load it (via require or by spawning it).

Call initPlugin with the faxbotAPI context.

The plugin will then log "initialized and scheduled", and every day will fetch data and send it via Faxbot.

Configuration in Practice: Ensure you provide a way for the user/admin to supply their Home Assistant URL and token to the plugin. This could be via environment variables (set on the Faxbot server host) as we assumed. In a more advanced implementation, you might allow the Faxbot UI to configure plugin settings (which could be saved in a config file or database and then passed to the plugin on init). For now, document in the plugin’s README that the user should set HOME_ASSISTANT_URL and HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN before running Faxbot with the plugin enabled.

Triggering on Demand: If desired, you could add a method in faxbotAPI (e.g. faxbotAPI.triggerPlugin(id)) that calls a plugin’s function. Our plugin could expose sendHealthData via the API as well. For example, we might attach faxbotAPI.triggerHealthReport = sendHealthData inside initPlugin, allowing Faxbot to invoke it. This way an admin could manually trigger a report (maybe via a button in the UI that calls an endpoint which in turn calls this function). This is an extra feature, but it shows how the plugin can register capabilities with the main application.

6. Final Notes and Usage

With the above system, adding a new plugin like faxbot-plugin-homeassistant becomes straightforward:

The developer publishes the plugin to NPM with the agreed naming and keywords.

The Faxbot UI allows the admin to discover it by searching the keyword (just like Scrypted’s plugin system allows in-app plugin search and install
docs.scrypted.app
).

The admin installs the plugin with one click. Faxbot downloads it and loads it.

The plugin’s initPlugin runs, registers its daily task.

Each day, the plugin fetches data from Home Assistant and uses Faxbot’s API to send out a fax or message with that data. (For example, Faxbot might send a fax report to a predefined fax number, providing daily health stats, which is useful in healthcare scenarios.)

Command-Line Example Recap: To tie it all together, here’s an example sequence of commands and steps:

Developer (you) publishes plugin: After writing the code, you run npm publish in faxbot-plugin-homeassistant directory (assuming you have an NPM account and the name is available). This makes it available via NPM for Faxbot to find.

Admin installs via Faxbot UI: Faxbot runs the equivalent of:

npm install --prefix plugins/faxbot-plugin-homeassistant faxbot-plugin-homeassistant


in the background. The console logs might show it downloading the package.

Faxbot loads plugin: Faxbot either forks a process or requires the module. If in the same process, you’d see any console logs from the plugin in Faxbot’s output (for instance, "Home Assistant health plugin initialized...").

Plugin runs daily task: Each day (or interval), the plugin will log or fax the data. If faxing, the Faxbot server might log an entry like "Fax sent to 1234567890" when the sendFax is invoked.

The architecture we’ve set up is modular and extensible. You (or other developers) can create additional plugins for Faxbot by following this model:

Use the naming convention (faxbot-plugin-xyz) or Faxbot scope.

Include the keywords in package.json.

Export an initPlugin(faxbotAPI) function to integrate with Faxbot.

Use Faxbot’s provided API methods to add new functionality (whether it’s sending data, reacting to events, etc.).

By implementing these steps, Faxbot gains a flexible plugin system similar to Scrypted’s, allowing it to grow through community contributions. The faxbot-plugin-homeassistant is just one example – it demonstrates connecting to an external system (Home Assistant) and feeding data into Faxbot’s workflow. With this groundwork, Faxbot users could develop plugins for other integrations (for example, plugins for different health devices, scheduling systems, or even AI services) simply by publishing new NPM packages and using the built-in discovery and installation mechanism.
