# Apps

Client apps for using Faxbot beyond the browser Admin Console.

- iOS app: mobile access to send/check faxes and manage keys.
- Desktop app: Electron-wrapped Admin Console with local integrations.

Tunnels are required for the iOS app to reach your Faxbot server (even when using cloud backends like Phaxio/Sinch). See the iOS page for details and the tunnels guide.
