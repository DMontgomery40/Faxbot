# Getting Started

Welcome to Faxbot! This section will help you get up and running quickly.

## What is Faxbot?

Faxbot is the first and only open-source, self-hostable fax API that combines:
- Simple REST API for sending faxes
- Multiple backend options (cloud and self-hosted)
- AI assistant integration via MCP
- HIPAA compliance features
- Developer SDKs for Node.js and Python

## Choose Your Path

Most users should start with the **Phaxio backend** for the easiest setup experience. If you need full control or want to avoid per-fax charges, consider the self-hosted SIP/Asterisk option.

For AI integration, check out our MCP guides after you have the basic API running.
